<h1>Shop Item Management Project</h1>

This project is a Shop Item Management System that allows users to Create, Retrieve, Update, and Delete (CRUD) items. It is built using Laravel and PHP.

Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository.
2. Locate the app-crud.sql file.
3. Import it into MySQL or phpMyAdmin to restore the database.
(If you don’t import the SQL file, you’ll need to manually set up the database from scratch.)
